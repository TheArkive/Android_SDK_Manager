# Android_SDK_Manager
A GUI for Android SDK Manager. Easily install/uninstall/update packages, and also set the user %PATH% var to include binary locations.

The platform-tools package gets some special treatment because there is no built in version management in the stock SDK Manager (only latest version of platform-tools). This is quite problematic since many older Android devices function better with older versions of platform-tools. With this tool, the process of switching versions of platform-tools is significantly simplified.
